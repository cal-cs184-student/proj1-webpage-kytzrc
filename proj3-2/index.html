            Due to one bounce radiance, we could see the light which is reflected by the spheres as well as most part of the background. However, since only one bounce is allowed, there are 
            neither refraction effect nor reflection from other objects, so the most part of spheres remains black.
        </p>
        
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">

            First we notice that the ceiling is lightened up. Because it is parallel to the light source, it requires at least two bounce for the light ray to hit the ceiling and 
            arrive at the camera. Then, since two bounce radiance is introduced, we could trace the ray which first hit the wall and then reflected by the sphere, so we could see the 
            reflection of the scene on the sphere on the left. However, for the same reason as above, the reflection of the ceiling remains black. For the sphere on the right, we can speculate
            that its material is mostly refractive, so we need more than two bounces to see though the shpere, however, we can still see minor reflection on it.
        </p>

        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

        <p>
            We can see the reflection of the ceiling has color now, this is because we are now able to trace rays that come from the ceiling and reflected by the shpere, which is a three-bounce
            ray. For the shpere on the right, we can see the wall through it now, because we are now able to trace three-bounce ray which first hit the wall and then go through the shpere 
            via two refraction. In addition, we can also see the light which directly pass through the sphere, instead of the whole black shadow.
        </p>

        <div align="center">

            The most conspicuous change is that the reflection of the right sphere in the left sphere is glassy now, rather than completely dark in the previous image. This is because 
            we are now able to trace rays which first hit the right wall, passing through the right sphere and eventually reflected by the left sphere, and this is also the reason why 
            the reflection of the right sphere looks blue. We can also see the right shpere rafracts the light on the wall next to it.

        <p>
            The scene looks brighter. More light are refracted by the right shpere rather than being reflected, so the reflection of the light on the right shpere looks more blurred.

            the first is with the least alpha(alpha = 0.005), it is the darkest one, and it show more red and purple color on dragons' body, compared with other three's.
        </p>
        <p>
            the second one is with the alpha = 0.05. it is less dark.(we can see this from the back of the dragon). it is less noisy, which we can figure out that low alpha always bring more noise.
        </p>
        <p>
            the third one is with alpha = 0.25. it is less dark when compared with first two images. it is affected by the global illumination less with first two images, because you can see less red color on the left side, and less purple color on the right side.
        </p>
        <p>
            the last one is with the highest alpha (alpha = 0.5). it is the least noisy one, and the dragon is kind of matte.
        </p>
        <p>
            High alpha values can lead to a matte appearance. Low alpha values indicates the material is smoother.
